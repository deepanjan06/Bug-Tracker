# Bug-Tracker
  Bug Tracker, is a bug-tracking application where a programmer/developer can report a bug by creating a project and adding the bugs within the project. Bug information can be further specified by adding class name, line numbers where bug issue starts and ends, bug status and also a brief description of the bug. After the developer has added the bug, a tester can work on the issue and update the bug information accordingly. After the bug is resolved, the tester can change the bug status to 'closed'.  The program records all the changes made to a bug. Double clicking on the bug will open up a 'bug history' form with records of all the previous changes, so that there is an audit trail of the bug.  For additional features, there is a admin panel which is only visible to the admin. It allows the admin to add/remove/modify users and users' details.
